        <div class="row">
            <p>As scientists worldwide continue to learn more about Covid-19, it becomes increasingly evident that,
                while
                crucial,
                social distancing measures are not enough to combat this pandemic. Mass testing, of both those who
                are
                symptomatic and
                asymptomatic, is a proven strategy to contain and end the virus.</p>
            <p>
                We know that Covid-19 has a median 5 day incubation period, during which the virus is very
                transmissible,
                and that 50%
                of those infected are asymptomatic., This combination of characteristics makes the virus
                particularly
                dangerous because
                carriers of the disease can infect others before they are not aware that they are themselves
                infected. This
                complicates
                self-isolation measures, as asymptomatic carriers may come to believe that they are healthy and
                should not
                be restricted
                by the orders, all the while transmitting the virus to their communities. Mass testing helps fight
                this
                effect on
                multiple fronts. A diagnosis via testing, not the presence or absence of symptoms, is the only way
                to know
                for sure
                whether or not one has contracted the virus. Those who test negative can return to their lives,
                while those
                who test
                positive know with certainty the importance of keeping themselves inside and eliminating the
                possibility of
                becoming
                transmitters of the virus. Further, health workers are then able to retrace patients’ recent
                movements, and
                find, test
                and isolate as needed the people with whom they have come into contact. In this way, mass testing is
                the
                best and only
                method to strategically stop the spread of Covid-19 by treating only those actually and potentially
                infected
                people,
                with the quickest and most minor interruption to society.</p>

                <p>Mass testing has already worked against the novel Coronavirus. In Vò Euganeo, an Italian town of
                    3,341
                    people, active
                    cases dropped from 89 to just 6 after the implementation of mass testing, a number which
                    subsequently fell
                    to 0. The
                    town tested every single one of its residents and quarantined the town for two weeks, at which point
                    they
                    retested every
                    resident. Those who were infected remained in isolation until they recovered, and the town reopened
                    and
                    experienced no
                    new cases. The death rate among those who contracted the disease was 1%, much lower than average.
                    South
                    Korea has also
                    been extremely successful in implementing mass testing to flatten their curve, even after their
                    country had
                    a
                    significant infected population, to begin with. These examples have valuable implications for the
                    world.
                    Some say that
                    mass testing is simply not viable on a large scale due to the resources it requires. South Korea has
                    shown
                    that with
                    inexpensive and widely-available tests, efficient and safe testing centers, and rapid results
                    turn-around,
                    mass testing
                    is worthwhile even without testing every resident. Others argue that it is too late to start mass
                    testing in
                    countries
                    with high infection rates. The experiment in Vò does speak to the importance of testing as soon as
                    possible,
                    but South
                    Korea again shows that even without the ability to contact-trace every infected individual,
                    resources like
                    live online
                    maps and timelines give their non-infected citizens critical information on how to stay safe.</p>

                <p>Further, the data that comes from testing is the most accurate and valuable information for the
                    public
                    health bodies,
                    medical research groups, and governments we are counting on to combat this pandemic. A former
                    director at
                    the WHO writes
                    that:
                    Large-scale testing is about more than identifying and isolating cases. Information about the virus
                    is
                    power. Testing
                    can help protect health workers and measure the progression of an epidemic. It can also provide
                    evidence
                    about regional
                    variation and how the virus affects people of different ages and genders. Virologists can use
                    information
                    about cases to
                    monitor the nature of the virus and any mutations. And data can show social and behavioural
                    scientists
                    whether their
                    physical-distancing measures are working.
                    Accurate virus models and statistics built from testing data are critical tools to inform other
                    antiviral
                    measures. In
                    order to understand the scope of the virus, and to learn what works to slow its spread and eliminate
                    cases,
                    public
                    health officials must have reliable information off which to base their decisions. Mass testing is
                    the basis
                    of all of
                    this.
